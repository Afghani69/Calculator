# Calculator

Just because everyone can make one, doesn't mean I shouldn't try to do one myself.

Did the basic layout of the calculator. Was actually quite fun! Played around with different designs and think I found one that I like.

The logic behind the calculator was actually easier than I thought it would be. Most of the struggles were my own idiocy (using '=' instead of '===').

I think it's done. I try and find bugs as I play with it some more.
